#### JavaScript allow you to to makeweb pages more interactive by accessin and modifying the content and markup use in web page while it's being viewed in the browser

#### A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
#### Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)



#### **How JavaScript make the pages more interactive**

- **ACCESS CONTENT**
- **MODIFY CONTENT**
- **PROGRAM RULES**
- **REACT TO EVENTS**

## Expressions & Operators


#### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

- **EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE**

- **EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE**

#### Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

####  **Types of Operators**

## Functions

#### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

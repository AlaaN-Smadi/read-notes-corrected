# How Does Computer Work

#### All computers from the first use until these days use the same technique to work , which is : Giving inpute , Storage Data , Make Processing and give the output .
#### As we see in the figure below :

## Binary System

#### Actully every things we see in computer's screen for example ; images , texts videos and so on , are easy to understand for us . But computer can not understand them by the same way .

#### Computer see these data as a groups of zeros and ones as a sequence . And each zero main false and one main true , and with processing and inhance these information it will convert into language and easy to understand for human .
#### The Table below show an example about this system with respect to word " hope " .

Characters | h | o | p | e
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
Binary value | 01101000 | 01101111 | 01110000 | 01100101


## Circuits and Logic

#### As we said , there are two types of codes that computers can understand , zero for false and one for true . When logic gates are connected they form a circuit.  Logic circuits are designed to perform a particular function, understanding the nature of that function requires a logic circuit truth table.

## CPU & Memory

#### The CPU of a computer, or central processing unit, is frequently compared to the human brain since it's the central control of the computer. The CPU performs computer operations by rapidly executing program instructions. The speed of the CPU plays a large part in determining the power of a computer. Each new generation of microprocessors features a more powerful CPU that can execute instructions more quickly than the previous generation.

#### The working of the CPU is defined as a three-step process. First, an instruction is fetched from memory. Second, the instruction is decoded and the processor figures out what it's being told to do. Third, the instruction is executed and an operation is performed. These three steps repeat in a cycle that begins again with the CPU fetching the next instruction. The steps are referred to as the instruction cycle of the CPU.

## Hardware and Software

####  Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer. Computer Hardware is any part of the computer that we can touch these parts. These are the primary electronic devices used to build up the computer. Examples of hardware in a computer are the Processor, Memory Devices, Monitor, Printer, Keyboard, Mouse, and the Central Processing Unit.

#### Software is a collection of instructions, procedures, documentation that performs different tasks on a computer system. we can say also Computer Software is a programming code executed on a computer processor. The code can be machine-level code or the code written for an operating system. Examples of software are Ms Word, Excel, Power Point, Google Chrome, Photoshop, MySQL etc.

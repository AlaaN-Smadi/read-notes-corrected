# Comparison and logical operators

1. Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==.


 #### You may be familiar with comparison operators from math class. Let’s make sure there aren’t any gaps in your knowledge.

- Less than (<) — returns true if the value on the left is  less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
- Greater than (>) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
- Less than or equal to (<=) — returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
- Greater than or equal to (>=) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
- Equal to (===) — returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
- Not equal to (!==) — returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

2. Logical operators — operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output. The operators include: &&, ||, and !.

#### Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one value is greater than another with >.

 #### There are scenarios, however, in which we must assert whether multiple values or expressions are true. In JavaScript, we can use logical operators to make these assertions.

- && (and) — This operator will be truthy (act like true) if and only if the expressions on both sides of it are true.
- || (or) — This operator will be truthy if the expression on either side of it is true. Otherwise, it will be falsy (act like false).

# Loops In JavaScript 

#### In general wehave three types of loops in programming ; for loop , while loop and do while loop .

- **For loop**

#### The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: ... for/in - loops through the properties of an object.


- **while loop**

#### The while statement creates a loop that is executed while a specified condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: for - loops through a block of code a number of times.

#### The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

- **RGB values**
#### These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 

#### Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255

- **hex Codes**
#### These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash '#' sign.

#### Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.

## Note
 
 ### It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content)

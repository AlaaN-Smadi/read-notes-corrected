#### The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.
#### It's written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.

### How to write script of web pages :

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

### So , What does the Script mean?
#### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
#### Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon

# Variables

#### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

#### There are too many types of variables ; We explain them in the table below .

Variable | Code Type | Data Type 
-------- | ------------- |---------
Integer | int |number
Float | float |number
Double | double | number 
String | string | text
Charachter | char | text
Boolian | bool | structure type that represents a Boolean value, which can be either true or false.
